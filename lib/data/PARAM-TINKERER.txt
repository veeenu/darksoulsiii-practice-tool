This release has two programs, Param Mod and Param Tinkerer.

# Param Mod

This consists of `dinput8.dll` and `param-mod.toml`.
Both files have to be in the `Game` folder of Dark Souls III.

`param-mod.toml` has covenant items 100% drop rate and Carthus Curved Sword 100% drop rate from the
skeleton in Carthus. To figure out what params to change, use the Param Tinkerer.

# Param Tinkerer

This consists of `param-tinkerer.exe` and `param-tinkerer.dll`.
Running the `.exe` will spawn the tool that allows you to edit the game parameters.
You can take note of the changes you want and then transfer them to the `.toml` file.

The format is not super clean and completely undocumented (as it constructs parameters
according to what is found in the game's memory) so crashes will happen, but feel free
to reach out for help.
